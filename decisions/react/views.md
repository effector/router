# Atomic router approach

`createRouteView` & `createRoutesView`

# Argon router approach

`createRouteView`, `createLazyRouteView` & `createRoutesView`

# Note

For async-bundled routes we need to use built-in `createLazyRouteView` function.

# Conclusion

Merge argon-router approach without changes.
