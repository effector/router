# Atomic router approach

`router.$query` & `querySync`

# Argon router approach

`router.$query` & `router.trackQuery`

# Note

Argon router's `trackQuery` has more possibilities to validate, match, write and read query parameters instead of atomic router's `querySync`.
Also argon-router has `router.$query` for straight writing & reading query parameters.

# Conclusion

Merge argon-router approach without changes.
